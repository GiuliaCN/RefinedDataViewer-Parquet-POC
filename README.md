This repository is a Proof of Concept (POC) for a distributed data processing pipeline built with .NET 8. The project demonstrates how to handle large datasets by offloading heavy processing from a Web API to a background Worker Service, utilizing SQL Server for state management and Parquet for optimized storage.
